- 👋 Hi, I’m Anirudha Gajula. Newly minted with a Degree in Political Science and minor in Biology. Decided to follow my heart into Data Analytics
- 👀 I’m interested in Healthcare data. However, I do not have a domain preference :) I'm looking to get my hands on any interesting data. You never know what could spark your interest. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about imputing data. There's no point in being well versed in producing analysis if you are conistently working with dirty data.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project. Feel free to hit me up! Im very familiar with R, MySQL, BigQuery and Tableau.
